					<h3>Working as a Fast Food Restaurant Part-Timer</h3><br><span>by Hafizah Ammar</span>
				<p>
<br>It has been a few days since my last day working as a part-timer in the F&B industry. Working in an industry that I have least experiences with is intriguing. I was amazed with myself that I could actually made it even though it is only for a short period of time. I learned a lot and looking forward to secure a permanent job soon. This post is mainly on what I learned while still working which maybe in another day I could read back to reminisce and improve myself to be better.<br><br>

To be honest, I struggled for the first two weeks in learning the routines and handling the appliances. As I do not have much experiences in the industry and everything was done in a fast pace, I was in anxiety. I was glad that my supervisor and manager were very helpful that finally later I could get a grip on it. We were told that we should at least knew the basics. And before I knew it, the basics were everything.<br><br>

This is a bit of what I learnt throughout the days.<br><br>

In a new place with a new job scope, we were not expected to know every single thing within the area. Thus, we should ask. We were very much expected to bombard them with questions so that we would know the do’s and don’ts, the rights and wrongs. As we were dealing directly with the customers, it is best to understand the services and the product that we were providing. Therefore, being well-equipped is probably a must. Even though it will take some time, effort will not be unseen.<br><br>

Teamwork was one of the essences of the job. We were frequently reminded that we work as a team. If we could not manage to handle certain work, we should ask for help. If other people were asking for help, we were supposed to lend a hand. Especially when the job involves physical work, as I believe not everyone could do the heavy work alone. Besides, a good teamwork should be able to maintain one’s mental-health. If a work load is too much to bear, it can cause a distress and anxiety to a person. Having it shared, it shall alleviate the burden of doing it alone. Which it is important to work things out with a team.<br><br>

Other than that, our communication skills were being groomed as well. It seems to be cliché but you will see its importance while being in the industry. We were interacting with numerous customers to promote our food product. Which our action towards customers is influential to the contribution of sales. If the customers feel well-treated and happy with the services, they will not feel bother to visit again. However, it is not limited to customer only. Communication skills between colleagues is also important to maintain good working environment.<br><br>

Thank you to my superior for giving me the opportunities to learn new skills which of those may not be taught in conventional classes. These experiences gave me new insight on how part of the industry works. Thank you very much!</p><br>
